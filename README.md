# What did i do
MWS sdk is out of date,so i rewrite it.now it is a composer package.

I resigned from that company a long time ago,so i cant have any access to amazon seller center.

When I have my own amazon store I will migrate all the MWS features to this package

# How to use
* rename MWSDefineExample.php to MWSDefine.php
* go to amazon seller center to get your own AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
* replace AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY with your ID and KEY
* go to amazon seller center to grant access to mws
* choose i want to access my own Amazon seller account with MWS
* replace MERCHANT_ID and MARKETPLACE_ID
